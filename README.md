## Lost Pet Finder

This is an android application for finding lost pets. The idea is to help people reunite lost pets with their owners.With smartphones being so ubiquitous now, we can use technologies like GPS, camera, and cellular data to solve the inefficacies of traditional posters


Each user can be signed in as a pet finder, or a pet owner who has lost their pet.

Upon login, the user has three possible actions: _Create A Report_, _Browse previous reports_, and _Contact Reporter_.

The effects of each action depend on what the type of the user is (finder or loser).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a finder finds a lost pet, they can create a found pet report. If a pet owner has lost their pet, they can create a lost pet report.

The report must contain: where the pet was found/lost, when the pet was found/lost, and an image of the pet.

The location can be set by placing a marker on a map:

<img src = "READMEPICTURES/2.png" width = "200">


The date is manually entered in _yyyy/mm/dd hr_min_ format.

The user can upload a picture of the found/lost pet either by taking a picture inside the app, or from their camera roll.

Completed report:

Once a report is completed, it can be used in the _other_ type of user's searches. That is, a found pet report will appear in a pet loser's searches, and a lost pet report will show up in a pet finder's searches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a user has found a pet and has reported it, they may search previously reported _lost_ pets, to see if there is a potential match. Likewise, someone who has lost a pet and reported it may seacrh previously reported _found_ pets for a match.

The search results are ranked on similarity. 

<img src = "READMEPICTURES/6.png" width = "200">

<img src = "READMEPICTURES/7.png" width = "200">

The above results' _similarity_ scores are compared to that of a light coloured dog.

A user may select _learn more_ to see the report information, the score breakdown of the similarity, and the contact button for the finder/loser.
